Title: Sparse and Dense Multidimensional Array Storage Engine for Data Science
Authors@R: c(person("TileDB, Inc.", role = c("aut", "cph")),

Description: The data science storage engine 'TileDB' introduces a
 powerful on-disk format for multi-dimensional arrays. It supports
 dense and sparse arrays, dataframes and key-values stores, cloud
 storage ('S3', 'GCS', 'Azure'), chunked arrays, multiple compression,
 encryption and checksum filters, uses a fully multi-threaded
 implementation, supports parallel I/O, data versioning ('time
 travel'), metadata and groups. It is implemented as an embeddable
 cross-platform C++ library with APIs from several languages, and
 integrations.
