Title: Universal Storage Engine for Sparse and Dense Multidimensional Arrays
Authors@R: c(person("TileDB, Inc.", role = c("aut", "cph")),

Description: The universal storage engine 'TileDB' introduces a
 powerful on-disk format for multi-dimensional arrays. It supports
 dense and sparse arrays, dataframes and key-values stores, cloud
 storage ('S3', 'GCS', 'Azure'), chunked arrays, multiple compression,
 encryption and checksum filters, uses a fully multi-threaded
 implementation, supports parallel I/O, data versioning ('time
 travel'), metadata and groups. It is implemented as an embeddable
 cross-platform C++ library with APIs from several languages, and
 integrations.

SystemRequirements: A C++17 compiler is required, and on macOS
 compilation for version 10.14 is required. Optionally cmake
 (only when TileDB source build selected), git (only when TileDB
 source build selected); on x86_64 and M1 platforms pre-built
 TileDB Embedded libraries are available at GitHub and are used
 if no TileDB installation is detected, and no other option to
 build or download was specified by the user.
