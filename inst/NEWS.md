# Ongoing


# 0.8.2

## Bug Fixes

* The `tiledb_stats_reset()` function is now exported, and `tiledb_stats_print()` has been re-added as a wrapper to `tiledb_stats_dump()` (#174)

* Configuration options for compute and input/output concurrency set only the new TileDB 2.1 configuration options; documentation on how to checking values has been expanded. (#175)

# 0.7.0

* This release of the R package supports [TileDB 1.7.7](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/releases/tag/1.7.7) and [TileDB 2.0.5](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/releases/tag/2.0.5)

## Improvements

- All S4 classes are now consistently documented or aliased (#117)

- If needed, the build system now builds TileDB and its required component (#118)

# 0.6.0

* This release of the R package supports [TileDB 1.7.7](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/releases/tag/1.7.7) and [TileDB 2.0.0](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/releases/tag/2.0.0)

## Improvements

- Added support for heterogenous domains

- Added support for string dimensions

- Added support for duplicate dimension values in sparse arrays

- Added support for data.frame object import and conversion to dense and
  sparse arrays

  sparse array attributes and domains

- Documentation and examples were enhanced and extended

- `tiledb_stats_dump()` is now simpler (but needs to be enabled first as
  usual)

- Support for nanosecond and integer64 columns was added, this is an optional
  feature for which the nanotime (and bit64) packages need to be installed

## Changes

- Dimension attributes must now be named


# 0.5.0

  iii) result size estimation and 'time travel' at to time-points has been
  added [#105](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-R/pull/105)
