# TileDB-R

The TileDB R package offers an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) interface to the [storage
engine](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) of [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/).

Note that the R interface to TileDB is under development, and the API is subject to change.

## Documentation

Documentation is available for [the R
package](https://tiledb-inc.github.io/TileDB-R/) as well as for the [TileDB
API](https://docs.tiledb.com/main/).

## Installation

TileDB Embedded needs to be present, and can be installed first (from a package or from source) for
the TileDB R package to build and link correctly. Alternatively, if no system installation is found,
a precompiled shared library is used during the installation of this R package.

The TileDB R package has been published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and be
installed directly via

    > install.packages("tiledb")

as usual.

The most recent released version can be installed from
[Github](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-R) using the package
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes).

    > if (!requireNamespace("remotes",quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
    > remotes::install_github("TileDB-Inc/TileDB-R")
    ...
    > library(tiledb)
    > tiledb_version()
    major minor patch
        2     0     8
    > help(package=tiledb)

If the TileDB library is installed in a custom location, you need to pass the explicit path:

    > remotes::install_github("TileDB-Inc/TileDB-R",
          args="--configure-args='--with-tiledb=/path/to/tiledb'")

Note that the TileDB R package is developed and tested against the latest stable (`v2.0.x`) version
of TileDB, but should also build against the newest development version.
